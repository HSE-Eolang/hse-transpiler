## What this repository is for?
This repository proposes and demonstrates an alternative branch of the EO transpiler based on a new transcompilation model of EO programs to Java source codes.  
The original (CQFN) model is depicted [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lM0FZHk=/).
And the visualization of this (HSE) model can be found [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lMMDKrk=/).  
Also you might want to read [a draft of our paper](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/Report-materials/raw/main/eorepo/EO%20Programming%20Language%20Transcompilation%20Model%20for%20Java%20Source%20Code%20Generation.pdf) that describes the model.
## How is this transpiler better?
Our transpiler has two great advantages:
1. It if much faster than the CQFN original implementation.
2. The code based on this transpiler is much easier to read and comprehend. Also, the [runtime](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/hse-runtime) library is also much more readable and understandable.

You can see the difference in performance of the old and the new models below:

## How to Contribute

First, fork and clone this repo to your local machine and go
to the `hse-transpiler` directory (you will need
[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
installed):

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:HSE-Eolang/hse-transpiler.git
$ cd hse-transpiler
```
Second, make changes to the code you would like to enhance or fix. Don't forget to write some tests!
Then, compile the transpiler (you will need
[Maven 3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/)
and [Java SDK 8+](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed):  
```bash
$ mvn clean install
```  
If everything is smooth, submit a PR. We would appreciate it!

Just in case if you are looking for the runtime implementation, it is [here](https://github.com/HSE-Eolang/hse-runtime).
Have a look at our samples in [this repository]([#examples](https://github.com/cqfn/eo/tree/master/sandbox/hse)).
